            <h3 class = "innercontainer1_1header"> Origins of Limerick Hurling </h3>

        Hurling has been in Limerick for as long as records exist.  In the 17th and 18th centuries it was played extensively throughout the county by teams representing local communities and landlord estate holdings.  Folklore has it that it was during this period of time that it became associated with faction fighting which led to great rivalry between neighbouring parishes.  Story tellers alive in the 1950's told of great faction fights in stonehall near Kilcornan and also at the fairgreen in Limerick city.  Casualites were high and many were mortally wounded during these events. It wasn't until 1884 when the GAA was founded that it became a rules based game. This eliminated much of the violence.  It also brought a great deal of popularity to the game as skills began to surface as an alternative to pure brawn as the defining characteristic of success.

            <h3 class = "innercontainer1_2header"> Clubs, and early successes. </h3>

        The first clubs began in Limerick city and some of the oldest include St.Patricks and Claughaun.  Later clubs to flourish included Old Christians, Patrickswell, and of course in the latter years Na Piarsaigh. Major clubs of note in east Limerick included Cappamore and Doon and in soth Limerick, Kilmallock & Garryspillane.  In West Limerick, Adare, Kileedy and Tournafulla were the major Hurling clubs.  Limerick won its first national title in 1897 when Kilfinane deafeated Tulloroan in the All-Ireland final.  In those days the Club champions represented their county in the All-Ireland which is different from the representative player model which exists today.   Limerick then went on to win all-Ireland finals in 1918 & 1921 when they won the Liam McCarthy for the first time. It was interesting that Declan Hannon from Adare lifted the Liam McCarthy exactly 100 years later in 2021.   The years 1917 to 1924 were very successful and Limerick contested Munster Finals every year.  In the 1930's Limerick won 5 National League titles and All-Irelands in 1934 and 1936 and 1940.   Limerick had a number of notable players in this era.  They included the infamous Mick Mackey and his brother John, Bob McConkey, Timmey and Mick Ryan and Paddy and Dave Clohessy.  The war years and subsequent two decades were lean time for Limerick Hurling and despite much effort, no silverware graced the mantlepiece until 1973.

            <h3 class = "innercontainer1_3header"> The Era 1973 to 2022 </h3>

        The 1973 team is pictured on our home page and included many players from a successful Harty Cup winning team in the 1960's.  Limerick lost to Galway in 1980 final and again to Offaly in 1994, and again to wexford in 1996. A further loss to Kilkenny in 2007 left supporters wondering if the county would ever win again.  All that ended in 2018.  Forty five years after the last win, Limerick's great heroes brought home the Liam McCarthy for what was to be the first of four Al-Ireland titles between 2018 and 2022.
