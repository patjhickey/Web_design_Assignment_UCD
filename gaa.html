            On 1 November 1884, a group of Irishmen gathered in the Hayes' Hotel to formulate a plan and establish an organisation to foster and preserve Ireland's unique games and athletic pastimes. Arising out of the meeting, the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) was founded. The architects and founding members were Michael Cusack of County Clare, Maurice Davin, Joseph K. Bracken, Thomas St George McCarthy, a District Inspector in the Royal Irish Constabulary,

               <h3 class = "innercontainer1_2header"> Croke Park </h3>
               
            Croke Park is the association's flagship venue and is known colloquially as Croker or Headquarters, since the venue doubles as the association's base. With a capacity of 82,000, it ranks among the top five stadiums in Europe by capacity.  It has undergone extensive renovations for most of the 1990s and early 21st century.

            While some units of the association outside Ireland participate in Irish competitions, the GAA does not hold internationals played according to the rules of either Gaelic football or hurling. Compromise rules have been reached with two "related sports". Hurlers play an annual fixture against a national shinty team from Scotland.
